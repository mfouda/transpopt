## Welcome to Transpopt.

*Note that this implementation relies purely on the standard [optimaltransport](https://github.com/LiamCattell/optimaltransport). Therefore, if one uses our package, please also cite the original [authors](https://github.com/LiamCattell/optimaltransport/blob/master/README.md).*

Did you ever want to calculate and measure a transporting function from a domain to another? Are you tired of re-implementing or not using state-of-the-art transforms? If yes, Transpopt is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of optimal transport transforms. Additionally, it includes high-level examples, commentaries, and extensive documentation to help you achieve your needs.

Use Transpopt if you need a library or wish to:
* Transport data from one domain to another;
* Design or use pre-loaded transforms;
* Mix-and-match different strategies to tackle your problem;
* Because it is fantastic to transport stuff.

Read the docs at [transpopt.readthedocs.io](https://transpopt.readthedocs.io).

Transpopt is compatible with: **Python 3.6+**.
